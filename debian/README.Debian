 Debian README for NAV
=======================

This is NAV (Network Administration Visualized) for Debian. With a default
package installation, NAV is not ready to run. You'll first have to finish the
following steps:

 1. Create PostgreSQL database

    If you said yes to automatically create and initialize the database during
    the installation of this package, you can skip this step.

    If you installed the PostgreSQL server locally, you need to pick a
    password for NAV's database user and put this into /etc/nav/db.conf like
    so:

      userpw_nav = mypassword

    Then run:

      su -c "/usr/lib/nav/navsyncdb -c" postgres

    Also take a look at /usr/share/nav/sql/README for details, especially if
    you need to install the schema on a remote PostgreSQL server.

    The default settings of the Debian PostgreSQL packages are good enough for
    smaller installations of NAV. If you are monitoring a large network,
    sooner or later you will run into performance problems with the PostgreSQL
    defaults. Please refer to [1] for tips on how to tune PostgreSQL settings.

 2. Configure Apache2

    o Run 'a2dissite 000-default && a2ensite nav-default'.

    o Restart Apache2 ('service apache2 restart').

    o We strongly recommend you modify
      /etc/apache2/sites-available/nav-default.conf to serve the NAV web
      interface over HTTPS in a production environment.

 3. Adjust the NAV configuration files in /etc/nav to fit your needs.

 4. Graphite

    NAV needs to know where Graphite's Carbon backend is listening for data,
    and on what URL it can reach the the Graphite web interface for metrics
    discovery and graph rendering. These values are configured in
    /etc/nav/graphite.conf.

    The Carbon backend's UDP listener must be enabled, and Carbon should be
    configured with NAV's storage schemas and aggregation rules. Details on
    how to configure Graphite for use with NAV can be found at [2].

    The recommended `graphite-carbon` package is available in the official
    Debian Wheezy distribution, but the `graphite-web` package is only
    officially available in Debian Sid (unstable). We have provided a backport
    of this package for Wheezy.

 5. Enable nav.service and start NAV:

      systemctl enable nav.service
      service nav start

 6. Log into the NAV web interface and change the admin user's password from
    the insecure default value of 'admin'.


Happy NAV-ing! :)
